## Detailed Analysis

### Backblaze B2 ‚≠ê (Top Recommendation)
```clojure
{:pros ["Lowest cost in industry"
        "Simple, predictable pricing"
        "Good S3 compatibility"
        "Strong API documentation"
        "Free tier available"]
 :cons ["Fewer regions than AWS"
        "Less ecosystem integration"]
 :best-for ["Cost-conscious projects"
            "Simple storage needs"
            "Backup/archive"]}
```

### DreamObjects
```clojure
{:pros ["Simple pricing"
        "Good support via DreamHost"
        "CEPH foundation"
        "Established provider"]
 :cons ["Limited regions"
        "Higher latency than some alternatives"
        "Less feature-rich than AWS S3"]
 :best-for ["DreamHost customers"
            "Medium-sized projects"
            "When support matters"]}
```

### Amazon S3
```clojure
{:pros ["Industry standard"
        "Most feature-rich"
        "Best ecosystem support"
        "Global infrastructure"]
 :cons ["Most expensive"
        "Complex pricing"
        "Potential vendor lock-in"]
 :best-for ["Enterprise needs"
            "When AWS integration matters"
            "Global distribution needs"]}
```

### Wasabi
```clojure
{:pros ["No egress fees"
        "S3 compatible"
        "Good performance"]
 :cons ["90-day minimum storage"
        "Less established"
        "Limited ecosystem"]
 :best-for ["Media storage"
            "Large file hosting"
            "When egress costs matter"]}
```

### MinIO
```clojure
{:pros ["Full control"
        "Local development"
        "No vendor lock-in"]
 :cons ["Requires maintenance"
        "Infrastructure costs"
        "Team expertise needed"]
 :best-for ["Local development"
            "Air-gapped environments"
            "Custom requirements"]}
```

## Recommendation

For your media processing pipeline:

1. **Primary Recommendation: Backblaze B2**
   - Lowest cost for large media files
   - Simple pricing model
   - Good API and documentation
   - S3 compatibility means your code remains portable

2. **Alternative: Wasabi**
   - If you expect high data retrieval
   - No egress fees could be significant for media processing

3. **Development: MinIO**
   - Local development and testing
   - Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
   - Can mirror production setup

## Implementation Strategy

```clojure
;; Abstract storage interface
(defprotocol ObjectStorage
  (store [this data metadata])
  (retrieve [this identifier])
  (list-objects [this prefix])
  (delete [this identifier]))

;; Implementation can be swapped
(defrecord B2Storage [credentials]
  ObjectStorage
  (store [this data metadata]
    ;; B2-specific implementation
    )
  ;; ... other methods

(defrecord DreamObjectsStorage [credentials]
  ObjectStorage
  (store [this data metadata]
    ;; DreamObjects-specific implementation
    )
  ;; ... other methods
```

## Migration Plan

1. Start with B2 for new media
2. Use MinIO for development
3. Keep code S3-compatible for flexibility
4. Consider multi-backend support:
   ```clojure
   {:development {:provider :minio
                 :endpoint "localhost:9000"}
    :staging {:provider :dreamobjects
              :endpoint "objects-us-east-1.dream.io"}
    :production {:provider :b2
                :endpoint "s3.us-west-002.backblazeb2.com"}}
   ```
